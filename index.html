    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organized and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the sfuss of money handling, making it safer and less coplicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.  </p>

<br>
3. Productivity / Efficiency
Monitoring and managing attendance manuallly can me a time-consuming, labourious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payrool manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources whcih lead to increased productivity and improves profits. And many more like visibility / insights, hassle free workflow managment, flexibility, integration / configuration, real-time tracking, security and compilance.
